		<h3>üìë Meaning</h3>
		<p style="font-family: 'Pretendard-Regular';">
			Front-end and Back-end were divided into separate teams for this project, and I led the entire team as the team leader. 
			It was a project where people who had never met before formed a team, and it was significant for each individual as it was the first project for everyone involved. 
			Throughout the project, we realized that soft skills are crucial for developers due to differences in opinions from the project overview to completion. 
			<br/> 
			Additionally, this project involved integrating external APIs, which none of us had prior experience with. 
			We also had limited knowledge of serialization and deserialization concepts in Spring, and we lacked experience in HTTPS to HTTPS deployment. 
			As a result, we anticipated encountering various issues throughout the process. 
			<br/> 
			However, in the end, we were able to overcome all our concerns and achieve satisfactory results by resolving these issues. 
			I consider this project as a stepping stone that allowed me to grow personally and professionally. 
			<br/> 
			This project experience enabled me to redefine my values as a developer and gain a deeper understanding of being a web developer. 
			Although acquiring diverse knowledge and implementing it posed challenges, it ultimately facilitated significant personal growth. 
			I am grateful to my team members who supported me throughout this journey.

		<h3>‚öΩ Troubleshooting</h3>
		<p style="font-family: 'Pretendard-Regular';">
			<p style="font-family: 'Pretendard-Regular'; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 0;">
				A. In Deployment : 
			</p>
			<p style="font-family: 'Pretendard-Regular'; padding-left: 10px;">
					1. Mixed content block: I initially hosted the deployment domain with HTTPS, but since the server address protocol was HTTP, there was a mixed content block due to the mismatch in protocols between the server and the client. To resolve this, I deployed the server with HTTPS as well. <br/> Although I was initially confused by the mixed content block error, I realized the importance of protocols in internet communication and how they can affect functionality. <br/><br/>
					2. CORS: Since I deployed the server application on an EC2 instance, I configured allowed origins in Spring Security to allow access from specific origins. I also configured CORS for S3 bucket on AWS. However, even after these configurations, CORS errors persisted when accessing the deployment link. After extensive research, I found a clue on Stack Overflow that suggested adding policies for CloudFront when deploying S3 website hosting via CloudFront. Finally, by adding a policy for CloudFront to my bucket policy, I resolved the issue. <br/> This experience made me realize that when using AWS services, there are various considerations to ensure proper configuration and functionality. It also highlighted that CloudFront provides more than just hosting capabilities. <br/><br/>
					3. AWS RDS external connection block: After completing deployment, I encountered issues with external connections to RDS from my local environment without any apparent reason or error message. Despite allowing all inbound rules for RDS during initial deployment setup, external connections were not established. Unable to find a solution through search alone, while reading through AWS official documentation step by step, I came across a statement suggesting that incorrect subnet settings could cause failures in external connections to RDS. As a result, I created new subnets and routing tables directly in AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and associated them with my RDS instance. Afterward, successful connections were established from my local environment. <br/> This experience helped me understand subnet and routing table relationships within computer networks and emphasized their importance for developers' understanding of networking concepts. <br/><br/>
					4. AWS account suspension: During the process of configuring deployment using AWS services, my account was suspended twice. <br/> The first suspension occurred when accidentally including an AWS access key in my local code while connecting to AWS services locally. Although aware of not exposing sensitive environment variables like access keys publicly, it turned out that an access key was present in one of my log files unbeknownst to me until after pushing it to GitHub repository which resulted in account suspension. Immediately upon discovering this issue through email notification from AWS, I removed both exposed access key files as well as deleting exposed keys themselves and contacted AWS support requesting reinstatement after resolving this issue.
					The second suspension occurred without any prior notice or explanation from
						AWS side suddenly suspending account due to suspicious activity related
						unauthorized attempts being made elsewhere tryingto access myAWS account without providing accurate evidence or documentation regarding such attempts causing immediate suspension at that point only two days before project deadline so i immediately emailed back asking for explanation about reasons behind suspension then i received response stating there seemed be some attempt being made unauthorizedly somewhere else causing such actions being taken . As it happened two days before project deadline , i immediately shared current situation along with thoughts team members asking their opinions discussed thoroughly finally decided create new aws account continue deploying project myself since whole process had do alone felt pressure completing everything within day invested personal time into successfully complete deployment result achieved successful completion requested deletion previous aws account which aws still yet provide precise evidence documentation regarding.
					Through these experiences , i realized importance maintaining secrecy server environment variables furthermore ,
					all remaining variables were hidden locally using parameter store provided by aws .
					Additionally , i became aware challenges managing multiple variables when utilizing external services as well recognized significance devops professionals their efforts field.
					<br/><br/>
					5. AWS EC2 instance overload :
					While EC2 instances managed handle certain level requests , they would stop responding once traffic exceeded certain threshold . Although swap area enabled instances ,
					traffic continued overwhelm them resulting unresponsiveness .
					Upon researching possible solutions , discovered ELB (Elastic Load Balancer) service provided by
					AWS distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers reducing burden individual servers .
					Immediately applied ELB configuration EC2 instance . Upon testing increased traffic levels observed no further unresponsiveness incidents CPU utilization rates also increased significantly according monitoring results .

					Through this experience , gained understanding importance handling traffic effectively . Also realized convenience offered by
					AWS services as well learned many companies rely heavily upon them .
			</p>
			<p style="font-family: 'Pretendard-Regular'; font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 0;">
				B. In Development :
			</p>
			<p style="font-family: 'Pretendard-Regular'; padding-left: 10px;">
				1. Gradle conflict with Spring Boot version dependencies : To use AWS Parameter Store , added implementation dependency gradle however gradle couldn't automatically align versions used Spring Boot versions already dependencies . Wondered if problem stemmed fact currently used Spring Boot version released recently within week decided manually add latest dependency implementation Maven repository specified forcedly define versions lower build.gradle dependencies thereby resolving version conflict problem .
				Asked senior developer about this issue informed problems like often occur developers experiencing them valuable experience improving problem-solving skills.
				
				<br/><br/>
				2. Unutilized Refresh token :
				In this project JWT implemented utilized only Access Token leading neglect Refresh Token .
				Upon conducting code review identified structural design flaw resulting oversight .
				Since only Access Token utilized contained sensitive information longer expiration time created potential issues.To address this redesigned Access Token include only user ID long type set shorter expiration time realized need API refreshing expired Access Tokens maintain user sessions . Collaborated frontend team members discuss designed solution involved checking expiration status Access Token if expired including Refresh Token header sending request refresh endpoint.After implementing API refreshing Access Tokens based on Refresh Tokens conducted testing achieved stable successful results .

				This experience highlighted importance token management demonstrated how initial design decisions can greatly reduce developer effort achieving satisfactory outcomes.

				<br/><br/>
				3 .High volume data retrieval External API integration :
				Retrieving JSON data External APIs proved burdensome due large volume data received requests .
				Implemented parsing class transforming JSON data desired format inject				
				Through this experience gained understanding significance effective data handling recognized need improve knowledge serialization deserialization concepts early stages development process.			</p>

			<h3>üìö Summary</h3>
			<p style="font-family: 'Pretendard-Regular';">
				While creating my portfolio, I felt that using PDF or other static representations was not enough, so I decided to create a portfolio website from scratch. 
				<br/> 
				Since I had no prior experience in front-end development, I had to study HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to some extent and used Bootstrap templates for the design. 
				<br/> 
				Although the implementation was done without HTTP communication, there were many aspects that required attention, making it challenging. 
				<br/>
				On September 19, 2023, I implemented automatic deployment through Github Actions.
				<br/>
			</p>
			<hr style="margin: 1rem 0px 1rem 0px;">
			<h3>üìë Meaning</h3>
			<p style="font-family: 'Pretendard-Regular';">
				This project was my first attempt at using technologies that I had no previous experience with. 
				<br/> 
				Initially, I planned to develop the website using the React framework. 
				However, after considering that a simple static hosting would suffice without requiring HTTP communication, I opted for static hosting. 
				Since my knowledge of design was limited at the time, I used Bootstrap templates for the layout. 
				<br/> 
				Configuring CSS and specifying styles for each component was confusing and required careful attention. 
				However, seeing the completed website gave me a sense of accomplishment, 
				and it also provided me with a better understanding of the challenges faced by front-end developers. 
				<br/> 
				For deployment, I used AWS S3 bucket for static website hosting. I purchased a domain and obtained an SSL certificate from ACM to deploy via CloudFront with HTTPS. 
				Finally, I hosted the S3 endpoint on Route 53 using my purchased domain. 
				<br/> 
				In conclusion, as an additional thought about this project, 
				I am considering refactoring it into a web application where authenticated users can write blog-style articles by implementing user authentication functionality in the future.
