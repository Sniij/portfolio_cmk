            &nbsp;영화 테넷 중 이런 대사가 있습니다.
            <br />개인적으로 재밌게 보았던 영화였는데, 이 대사가 개발 공부를
            하면서 꽤 많은 공감하게 됐습니다. <br />
            이론적으로 이해되지 않는 부분을 몇 줄의 코드를 작성하며 직접 구조를
            느껴보니 테넷의 대사를 떠올리게 되면서 
            개발이라는 분야는 이론적인 부분을 배우며 손으로 직접 타이핑해야만 내
            것이 될 수 있음을 느꼈습니다. <br /><br />

            &nbsp;The ancient Roman architect Vitruvius once identified the three elements of architecture as stated above. Doesn't it seem similar to development? <br />

            &nbsp;Before I fell in love with development, I was fond of architecture. Architecture may be seen merely as building structures, 
            but in fact, a single piece of architecture implies an intention to create "a space sufficiently independent from the external environment 
            where people can feel comfortable and perform activities suitable for the purpose of that space". 
            In this regard, how this space was designed with what intent or meaning, 
            how it is intended to appear, and how actual people are supposed to use it are all considered during construction until it becomes a final architectural structure. 
            But I think this is similar to development. If we take a developed application as an example, 
            it's "a space created for actions suitable for user's purpose", and while implementing this, 
            developers consider what actions users will take and how they want it to appear. Ultimately, 
            both architecture and development create optimized living environments for humans through the fusion of various technologies.

            As a child who was charmed by architecture at one point dreamed of becoming an architect. However, without deeply considering why I liked it so much; 
            I gave up due to adults' opinions that being an architect in Korea is challenging. Why do I find development fun now? It might be because it's similar to architecture. 
            In both fields -architecture and development-  I enjoy understanding what someone has implemented or developed intended to look like or mean; 
            making them my own through this process also leaves great value for me as an action leaving tremendous accomplishment.
            
            Furthermore,
            If someone uses what I have implemented or developed and understands its intentionality while contemplating its appearance; that would be overwhelmingly fulfilling.
			  <br />
			  &nbsp;Along with my passion for development considering stability, usefulness beauty or beyond those elements; by continuously investing effort into writing good code -
        I dream about becoming someone whose value increases over time creating an amazing learning curve.

            The technologies I am proficient in are as follows. These are not just one-off experiences, but skills that have been incorporated into actual projects.

            Language
            </p>

            -Java(11): I understand the basic syntax and aim to design code based on the four fundamental pillars of object-oriented programming design: inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism, and abstraction.            
            <p
            style="

            >
            Framework, Library
            </p>

            -Gradle : I can manually ensure compatibility with libraries needed for each task from sources like Maven Central. I have experience writing scripts for Rest Docs and CI/CD.<br/>
            -Spring Boot : I have experience developing Restful APIs based on the Spring MVC pattern.<br/>
            -Spirng Data JPA : I have experience implementing entities and relationships in table structure data modeling.<br/>
            -Spring Security : In Spring-based applications, I've implemented authentication and authorization using JWTs, as well as used OAuth2.0.<br/>
            -Spring Rest Docs : Using Mockito, I've created Spring Rest Docs API documents.<br/>
            -Spring Cloud : Through Spring Cloud, I've used AWS S3 client and managed secret information using Parameter Store.<br/>
            -RestTemplate : Used to call external APIs.<br/><br/>

            Database
            </p>

            -MySQL : Understanding relational databases allows me to do basic design. For performance improvement in queries generated by Spirng Data JPA, there's an experience of designing queries directly.

            The others
            </p>

            - Git : In team projects, my hands-on experiences include designing Git strategy myself and leading project management along with conventions.<br/>
            - Github : Scripting for Github actions allowed me to automate client-server deployment processes.<br/>
            - AWS : Experiences include Https-to-Https deployment; development environment setup in a deployed environment; 
            RDS monitoring via Cloud Watch; IAM management - all these required self-studying network knowledge relevantly<br/>
            - Notion : Used as a communication tool for rules enforcement deadline tracking information sharing etc., during team projects.<br/><br/>
